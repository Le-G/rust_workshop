### Step 1: Setup and Hello World

Let's begin with a basic Rust project setup. Rust has an excellent build system and package manager called `cargo`. We'll use it to start our new project:

```bash
cargo new workshop_project
cd workshop_project
```

In the `src/main.rs` file, you'll find the classic "Hello, World!" program. Run it using `cargo run`. You'll see Rust's power right from the start: Cargo automatically downloads, compiles, and links the necessary dependencies before running your program.

Rust offers type safety and memory safety without a garbage collector, and that's something you'll appreciate coming from a TypeScript background.

Now let's move on to [Part 2](./part2.md) !
